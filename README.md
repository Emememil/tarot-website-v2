# Emil William | Software Engineer & Creative Craftsperson

A high-performance portfolio showcasing the intersection of **Systems Engineering (Rust)** and **Modern Web Architecture (React)**. This project is a testament to my philosophy: *Software is a craft, and the developer is an architect of experiences.*

## Engineering Philosophy: Craft & Velocity

I believe in **AI-augmented development** to achieve production-ready results at high velocity without sacrificing technical rigor.
- **The Craft:** Every component, from modal state transitions to viewport-aware animations, is built for maintainability and accessibility.
- **The Velocity:** Leveraging advanced AI workflows (Claude/Gemini) to move from concept to deployment in record time, focusing on solving complex logic rather than repetitive syntax.

## Technical Deep Dive

### 1. Hybrid Architecture (Web + Systems)
My work bridges the gap between high-level UI and low-level performance.
- **Cinera App:** Explores the high-performance world of **Tauri and Rust**, bringing a sleek React frontend to a native desktop environment.
- **Spotify Dashboard:** Implements complex data visualization and third-party API orchestration.
- **Expense Splitter Pro:** A PWA focusing on robust state management and real-time UI updates.

### 2. UI/UX Architecture
- **Reusable Animation Wrappers:** Built a custom `<AnimatedContent />` component leveraging `framer-motion` to handle `whileInView` logic, custom delays, and load-triggers globally.
- **Accessible Interactions:** Modal systems feature **body-scroll locking** and **keyboard event listeners (Esc)** for a native-app feel.
- **Clean Component Logic:** Separation of concerns between data (`projects.js`), styling (CSS Modules), and presentation logic.

## About Me

I am a **BCA Graduate (2025)** with a background in creative arts. My transition from music production to software engineering gives me a unique perspective on "Logical Creativity." 

- **Current Focus:** Mastery of React, TypeScript, and Rust.
- **Future Goals:** Pursuing a Master's in Germany to specialize in Advanced Software Systems and High-Performance Computing.
- **Creative Side:** Music composition, singing, and guitar—logic meets melody.
