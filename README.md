# Mystic Tarot - Professional Tarot Reading Website

A premium, fully responsive tarot reading website built with React, TypeScript, and modern UI/UX principles.

## 🚀 Development Philosophy: Speed & Precision
**This project was a rapid prototyping experiment.** By leveraging AI-augmented development (Claude/Gemini) alongside a custom Tailwind component architecture, I built this production-ready landing page from scratch in under 4 hours. 

The focus was on maintaining high code quality and TypeScript safety while hitting "startup-speed" delivery targets.
